Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
        Yes, ai tries to find a best position to place white tiles, in which more tiles can be fliped
        walk through a for loop by row,
            walk through a for loop by column, 
                calculate the number of tiles which can be fliped in this position
                if the number is the highest number so far, we mark it as the position ai wants to place tile in
        at the end of for loops, we know in which position ai can flip more tiles

If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
        Yes,
        It is as smart as I would like because the posibilities that ai wins are greater than the posibilities human win

How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
        walk through a for loop by row,
            walk through a for loop by column, 
                calculate the number of tiles which can be fliped in this position
                if the number is the highest number so far, we mark it as the position ai wants to place tile in
        at the end of for loops, we know in which position ai can flip more tiles
How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
    I played this game 17 times and computer program beat me 9 times
How would you improve it in the future? 
    When ai finds there are several ways it can flip the most tiles, we can predict that which one can make player flip less tiles.
