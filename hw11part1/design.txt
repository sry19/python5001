           3. change color - change color w<->b if needed

2.  disks - stores all disks
           1. __init__

              3.row number
              4.col number
              5.number of white disks

           3. add disk - add new disk to disks and count
           4. change color - by calling disk.changecolor() and count
           5. flip - given color, row index and col index, flip all disks that can be fliped
           6. invalid - check if player can put disk in this position

3.  maze - draws the maze and displays the disks
           1. __init__
              1.WIDTH
              2.HEIGHT
              3.gamecontroller
              4.disks
              5.current color
           2.change color - by calling disks.changecolor()
           3.check is valid - Checks if there is any place that player can put disk in
           4.update - finds if anyone wins
           5.display - display the maze and disks
           6.add disks - check if palyer can put disk, then add disk and flip

4.  game controller - Maintains the state of the game
           1. __init__
                1.WIDTH
                2.HEIGHT
                3.white wins

   do not do anying and wait for another try
When the user makes a legal move

    choose a best way to put disk
